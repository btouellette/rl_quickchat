# rl_quickchat
AutoHotkey script to add custom quick chats for use in Rocket League

I've provided two versions of the script, one is the version I use with my 360 controller (RL_QuickChat_Controller.ahk) and Joy2Key and another that has keybindings precustomized for keyboard usage (RL_QuickChat_KB.ahk).

How to Use
------
1. Download and unzip repository: https://github.com/btouellette/rl_quickchat/archive/master.zip
2. If you want to use a controller install and configure [Joy2Key](http://joytokey.net/en/ "Joy2Key")
3. Open **RL_QuickChat_Controller.ahk** or **RL_QuickChat_KB.ahk** and customize to taste. You can:
  * Change the messages
  * Assign keybindings (default for KB is F1 for opening the chat menu and 1/2/3/4 for selecting message)
  * Change ControllerMode so that appropriate DPad images display
  * Change position of the popup (default position is appropriate for 1920x1080 displays)
  * Add as many new message groups with their own keybindings as you want
4. Run AHK file
5. Launch Rocket League and enjoy!
